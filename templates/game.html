  <p>We know your energy can be drained from working so diligently, so why not play a little mini game as you take a break :)</p>
  <p>Bad Bunny is a minigame, the object is to click the bunnies away from the carrot in the middle of the screen for as long as you can</p>
  <p>Every 10 seconds of survival, the level goes up by one</p>
  <p>Every time the level goes up, the speed of the bunnies and the number of bunnies that come after the carrot increases</p>
  <p>Your score is the number of seconds you manage to survive</p>
